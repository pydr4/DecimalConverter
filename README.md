# DecimalConverter
Decimal base system converter. Converts base10 number to octal(base8) and binary(base2)

This is a simple Base conversion application. 
It's an application which converts Base 10 numbers to octal and binary using click of a button.

Actual conversion happens in Logic.NumberingSystemConverter. DecimalToBaseSystem function takes whole number (long number) and second parameter takes in base value. Base value can be chosen from predefined enums or just int 8 and 2. Anything below 10 would work in this case.
